# Github Actions Matrix Build 
This is the fifth Assignment for Data Engineering on Github Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions.

This code is run for 5 different versions of Python: **3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12**. GitHub Actions Matrix is configured to automate testing across multiple Python versions. The matrix is set up to test the code compatibility with Python versions. Each time a change is pushed to the repository, the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered to ensure the code runs correctly on all specified Python versions.

# F1 Fastest Lap Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the fastest lap data from the 2024 Italian Grand Prix. The main focus is to determine the driver with the highest average speed for a given team. The project is implemented in Python, with a simple command-line interface and unit tests to verify the functionality. 


## Code Description

### `main.py`

- **Functionality**:
  - **`get_driver_with_highest_avg_speed(car_name)`**: 
    - Takes the name of a car/team as input.
    - Filters the data to find the driver with the highest average speed for that team.
    - Returns the driver's name, the lap number, and the average speed.
  - **User Interaction**: The script prompts the user to enter a team name and displays the corresponding fastest lap details. For the CI/CD pipeline the input is hardcoded. However, it can be taken as an input from the user.

### `test_main.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the `get_driver_with_highest_avg_speed` function.
- **Tests**:
  - **`test_mclaren_mercedes`**: Ensures that the function correctly identifies Norris as the fastest driver for McLaren Mercedes.
  - **`test_mercedes`**: Ensures that the function correctly identifies Hamilton as the fastest driver for Mercedes.
  - **`test_nonexistent_team`**: Checks the behavior of the function when a non-existent team is provided.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in a CSV file located in the `data/` directory:

- **`italian_gp_2024_fastestlaps.csv`**: Contains lap time, driver, car, average speed, and other relevant details from the 2024 Italian Grand Prix.
